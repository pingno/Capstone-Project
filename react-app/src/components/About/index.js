        <div>About the Creator</div>
        <div>Hi, my name is Peang!</div>
        <div>Throughout my life, I've harbored a keen interest in various fields and engaged in numerous hobbies. However, some of these interests remained mere concepts, lacking a clear roadmap for implementation. While I did pursue my passions, I found myself hesitant to explore alternative opportunities, unsure of where to begin.


      I've consistently advocated for others to follow their ideas or pursue their passions, emphasizing the importance of taking that initial step and embracing the learning process. The motivation behind creating this social platform was to inspire individuals to embark on their own journeys, encouraging them to step into whatever endeavor they believe will bring them joy.
